    <p>END OF COPYRIGHT NOTICE, DISCLAIMER, and LICENSE.</p>
    <p>TRADEMARK</p>
    <p>The name &quot;libpng&quot; has not been registered by the Copyright owner as a trademark in any jurisdiction. However, because libpng has been distributed and maintained world-wide, continually since 1995, the Copyright owner claims &quot;common-law trademark protection&quot; in any jurisdiction where common-law trademark is recognized.</p>
    <p>OSI CERTIFICATION:</p>
    <p>Libpng is OSI Certified Open Source Software. OSI Certified Open Source is a certification mark of the Open Source Initiative. OSI has not addressed the additional disclaimers inserted at version 1.0.7.</p>
    <p>EXPORT CONTROL:</p>
    <p>The Copyright owner believes that the Export Control Classification Number (ECCN) for libpng is EAR99, which means not subject to export controls or International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) because it is open source, publicly available software, that does not contain any encryption software. See the EAR, paragraphs 734.3(b)(3) and 734.7(b).</p>
